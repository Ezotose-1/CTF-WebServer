    <h3>What is a CTF?</h3>
    <p>
        Capture the Flag <b>(CTF)</b> in computer security is an exercise in which "flags" are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable
        programs or websites. Competitors have to find all flags hidden in a website by bypassing the security of the system and using
        a maximum vulnerability they can.

    <h3>Specificities of this CTF</h3>
    <p>
        There is a total of <b>12 FLAGS</b> hidden everywhere. Some are really easier than other. <br>
        Flags are this <b>and only this type</b> : 3 lorem ipsum words dash separated like (example only): <i>Lorem-Ipsum-Dolor</i> <br>
        A flag is unique and can be found valid, only once. <br>
        We have tried to combined many challenges has possible including 'Web client-side', 'Web server-side', 'Cryptanalyse', 'Steganographie', 'Decryption'...

        Posting or sharing solution is damaging the good state of the game.
